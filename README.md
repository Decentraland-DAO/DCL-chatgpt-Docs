# DCL-Docs

DCL-Docs is a chatbot designed to answer questions about most matters related to [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/). This project has been funded by [DecentralandDAO](https://dao.decentraland.org/).

Below is a guide for implementing DCL-Docs, consisting of four steps. The first three steps result in several .txt files that are comprehensible not only by ChatGPT but also by other Large Language Models (LLMs), including open-source ones. Step four details how to implement it in ChatGPT, due to its popularity and ease of use. However, users are free to experiment, replicate, or enhance DCL-Docs as they wish.
